It will help people in making a smart and efficient decision on choosing excellent neighborhoods out of numbers of other neighborhoods in Scarborough, Toronto.\n\nMany people are migrating to many different states of Canada and need a lot of research for sound housing prices and reputed schools for their children. This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods. For ease of accessing to Cafe, School, Supermarket, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like-minded people, etc.\n\nThis project intends to create an analysis of features for people who are migrating to Scarborough in search of the best neighborhood as a relative analysis between neighborhoods. The highlights include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for an emergency, water resources both fresh and wastewater and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.\n\nIt will help people to get the awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life.\n"
